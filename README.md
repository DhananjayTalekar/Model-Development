# Used Cars and Laptops Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars and laptops using real-world datasets. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. The key algorithms used in this project include:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Multiple Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**

## Project Description

### Used Cars Price Prediction

- **Dataset**: Contains various features of used cars such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, etc.
- **Objective**: Predict the selling price of used cars based on these features.
- **Approach**: The dataset is preprocessed, and different regression models are trained and evaluated to predict the car prices accurately.

### Laptops Price Prediction

- **Dataset**: Includes features related to laptops such as brand, model, RAM, storage, processor type, etc.
- **Objective**: Estimate the price of laptops based on their specifications.
- **Approach**: Similar to the used cars dataset, preprocessing and regression models are applied to predict laptop prices.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: A basic approach where the relationship between the target variable and features is modeled as a straight line.
- **Multiple Regression**: An extension of linear regression that includes multiple features.
- **Polynomial Regression**: A technique that models the relationship between the target variable and features as a polynomial function to capture non-linear patterns.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DhananjayTalekar/Model-Development.git
   cd Model-Development
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Python installed. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Data Preparation**

   - Download the datasets from the provided links or upload your datasets into the `data/` directory.
   - Make sure the file paths in the scripts are correctly set to match your data locations.

4. **Run the Notebooks/Scripts**

   - For used cars price prediction, run the Jupyter notebook or script located in `notebooks/used_cars_price_prediction.ipynb`.
   - For laptops price prediction, run the Jupyter notebook or script located in `notebooks/laptops_price_prediction.ipynb`.

5. **View Results**

   After running the notebooks/scripts, you can view the results and analysis in the output files or directly in the Jupyter notebooks.
