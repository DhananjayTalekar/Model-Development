# Used Cars and Laptops Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars and laptops using real-world datasets. The objective is to build predictive models to estimate the selling price of used cars and laptops based on various features. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and applying different machine learning algorithms to create accurate predictive models.

## Project Description

### Used Cars Price Prediction

- **Dataset**: Contains features of used cars such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, etc.
- **Objective**: Predict the selling price of used cars based on these features.
- **Approach**: The dataset is preprocessed, and different regression models are trained and evaluated to predict car prices accurately. Models used include:
  - Linear Regression
  - Multiple Regression
  - Polynomial Regression

### Laptops Price Prediction

- **Dataset**: Includes features related to laptops such as brand, model, RAM, storage, processor type, etc.
- **Objective**: Estimate the price of laptops based on their specifications.
- **Approach**: Similar to the used cars dataset, preprocessing and regression models are applied to predict laptop prices. Models used include:
  - Linear Regression
  - Multiple Regression
  - Polynomial Regression

## Machine Learning Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: A basic technique where the relationship between the target variable and features is modeled as a straight line.
- **Multiple Regression**: Extends linear regression to include multiple features for better predictions.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Captures non-linear relationships by modeling the target variable as a polynomial function of the features.

## Model Evaluation

Model evaluation is crucial to determine how well the predictive models perform. Key aspects include:

- **Performance Metrics**: Use metrics like R-squared (R²), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate model accuracy.
- **Cross-Validation**: Apply cross-validation to ensure the models generalize well to unseen data.

## Over-fitting, Under-fitting, and Model Selection

- **Over-fitting**:
  - **Definition**: When a model learns the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns, leading to excellent training performance but poor generalization to new data.
  - **Detection**: Observe a large gap between training and validation performance.
  - **Solution**: Apply techniques like regularization, reduce model complexity, or increase training data.

- **Under-fitting**:
  - **Definition**: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns, resulting in poor performance on both training and validation datasets.
  - **Detection**: Consistently poor performance on both training and validation datasets.
  - **Solution**: Increase model complexity, add more features, or use more sophisticated algorithms.

- **Model Selection**:
  - **Process**: Evaluate multiple models based on performance metrics and validation results. Use cross-validation to select the model that balances performance and generalization ability.

## Ridge Regression

- **Definition**: Ridge regression is a regularization technique that helps address multicollinearity by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which shrinks the coefficients and reduces overfitting.
- **Implementation**: Use `sklearn.linear_model.Ridge` to apply Ridge regression and compare its performance with standard linear regression models.
- **Benefits**: Improves model generalization and handles multicollinearity.

## Grid Search

- **Purpose**: Grid Search is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for Ridge regression by exhaustively searching through specified parameter values.
- **Implementation**: Use `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` to perform Grid Search and determine the best alpha value for Ridge regression.
- **Outcome**: Provides the best hyperparameters for enhancing model accuracy.
